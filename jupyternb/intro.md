# Lidar Simulator

This repository contains a Lidar simulator that generates Lidar scans in different environments either based on 3D models or mazes in ASCII format.

We use these Lidar scans to test different algorithm for perception, localization and path finding.

## Known Execution Errors
As generator for STL files we will use <a href="https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target=\"_blank\">Build123d</a> This tool is not installed when generation the jupyter book, hence Square, Race Track and Box will show execution errors in the jupyter notebook
