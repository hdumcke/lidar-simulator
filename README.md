# lidar-simulator

This repository contains a Lidar simulator that works with 3D models or with mazes in ASCII format.

It is used to test different perception, localication and path finding algorithm.

This is still very much work in progress.

## Jupyter Notebooks

We use nbstripout to filter the output of the jupyter notebooks and we also use jupyter-book to create HTML or PDF output that you can find in docs. The PDF is in docs/book.pdf
